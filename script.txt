Once, a lake dried up in the ancient kingdomof Chu because of the prolonged drought.,The fish in the pond experienced significanthardship as they struggled to survive, flopping,around in the remaining mud puddles.,Zhuangzi observed how the fishes smeared eachother with slime and exchanged saliva to help,each other stay alive.,Even though he admired their solidarity, heasked himself if it wouldn’t be better if,the lake were full, so the fish could swimfreely without needing each other to take,drastic measures for survival.,From a place of modern-day individualism,we may look back on the past, feeling nostalgic,about the degree of human solidarity and communityback then.,Like the fishes in Zhuangzi’s story, peoplehelped and relied on each other and were involved,in each other’s lives.,And so, as humans do, they formed close-knitcommunities.,These communities provided a sense of safetyand social interaction; in many ways, they,made people’s lives easier.,Moreover, in times of crisis, group solidaritywas even more prevalent.,Plenty of wartime stories sketch an almostromantic image of how people supported each,other during these times of great adversity:war makes people come together, and shared,sorrow is half sorrow.,Last decades, a period of relative stability,economic growth, and technological advancement,,the world, by and large, has become more individualistic.,Of course, we can still find collectivismand close communities in many parts of the,world, but overall, human beings have becomeless reliant and less involved with each other,,and more focused on themselves.,Especially in wealthy Western countries, peopledon’t need each other anymore as they used,to.,The declined mutual reliance isn’t justbecause of wealth but also because technology,makes human interaction increasingly obsoletein many areas.,And so, the lake is full.,Like the fish, we’ve largely become self-reliant,allowing us to swim freely and forget about,each other.,Yet, now people need each other less and less,on a communal level at least, a new problem,has arisen.,The experience of loneliness is prevalentin individualistic societies.,We can’t deny that loneliness is problematic.,However, without reducing the severity ofthis issue, we might also have been underestimating,the advantages of ‘not needing people.’,This video expands on Zhuangzi’s story aboutthe fish and why a lake full of water is actually,highly joyful.,A lone fish swimming in a lake full of waterdecides wherever it goes, looking for food,and shelter when needed.,He can meet other fish but part ways wheneverhe wants to continue his individual journey.,Likewise, inhabitants of an individualisticsociety are free to choose their own paths.,Most of the time, socializing with other peopleis an option, not a necessity, so they’re,free to move on from these people if theywish to.,We can observe that ‘not needing’ closerelationships to live indeed leads to people,minding their own business.,Even though humans still depend on other humansto survive, we don’t need their company,,as in physical presence and personal relationships,for survival.,And thus, social ties have become an option,not a requirement.,A well-oiled system that largely relies ontechnology takes care of our needs.,We can order anything with a click of a mouse;we can pay people to provide us with almost,any kind of service, such as relocation, cleaning,or taking care of us when where’s sick.,In Europe, self-scanning checkouts are becomingthe norm.,With the emergence of AI, things like thetype of companionship we previously reserved,for a spouse can be replaced by advanced robots.,Although the latter example may sound extreme,it shows how little we’ll need each other’s,company in the future to meet our needs ifsuch technological advancements become mainstream,and widely used.,A world where we don’t need to meet andspeak to each other may sound like a dystopian,nightmare to some.,In all likelihood, many people would be crushedby the levels of loneliness within societies,in which human-to-human contact is so infrequent.,But aside from these severe consequences,could the ‘not-needing-each other’ aspect,of such circumstances benefit us?,Imagine we’re all fish in a rich, vast ocean,free to explore all its depths, mysteries,,and knowledge.,The path to adventure lies open, calling usto explore and experience new things.,We may do this together with someone, butas we can fend for ourselves, we can easily,take this journey alone; a companion is optional.,The freedom from people allows us the freedomto spend our every waking minute swimming,wherever we want and doing whatever we want,whenever we want.,Such freedom and independence within the physicalworld can be a great pleasure if one enjoys,the solitary path.,Albert Einstein, for example, was a true lonefish, enjoying the distance between himself,and others while excelling in solitude andprofoundly caring about other people’s well-being.,I quote:,My passionate sense of social justice andsocial responsibility has always contrasted,oddly with my pronounced lack of need fordirect contact with other human beings and,human communities.,I am truly a ‘lone traveler’ and havenever belonged to my country, my home, my,friends, or even my immediate family, withmy whole heart; in the face of all these ties,,I have never lost a sense of distance anda need for solitude.,Carl Jung and Emma Rauschenbach became engagedin 1902; they later married and had five kids,together.,Jung was keeping a diary at that time, inwhich he wrote:,I am no longer alone with myself, and I canonly artificially recall the scary and beautiful,feeling of solitude.,This is the shadow side of the fortune oflove.,End quote.,So, Carl Jung realized that through his commitmentto marriage, he had given up a precious thing:,the experience of being alone.,When dealing with people is optional, we’refree to retreat and spend time in solitude.,Even though some people cannot tolerate beingalone and instead choose to surround themselves,with people as much as possible, the experienceof solitude benefits those who appreciate,it, whether imposed or chosen.,Regarding interpersonal relationships, notneeding people can be a blessing.,Yes, in earlier times, there was more solidarity,group activity, and involvement in each other’s,lives.,But close-knit communities could be detrimentalto one’s tranquility as we automatically,become part of the drama people are capableof.,For some reason, no matter where we look,when people come together, there’s always,some form of turmoil, be it gossip, bullying,people antagonizing each other, or fights.,When people depend on each other, it’s theunfortunate part of the deal.,But if we don’t need these people, we don’thave to tolerate their behavior; we don’t,have to bear the cross of associating withthose we don’t like just to get our needs,met.,Mainly in Western countries, but without adoubt in other places of the world as well,,we observe that, regarding survival, the institutionof marriage has been rendered optional rather,than mandatory.,The religious authorities that used to forcepeople to marry have significantly lost their,influence.,On a practical level, men and women can survivewithout each other, and many of them successfully,sustain themselves.,This development has both negative and positiveconsequences.,For example, the divorce rate has been risingsteadily, translating to an increase in broken,homes.,And the rising number of people who refuseto marry and procreate has led to a population,crisis in Japan.,People automatically become more selectivewhen there’s no necessity to be in a relationship,or marriage.,After all, they don’t need anyone, and theymight even enjoy the perks of being single;,sometimes, they love singlehood so much thatthey won’t easily exchange it for commitment.,A commitment to a relationship can be veryfulfilling and satisfying but has plenty of,potential risks and downsides as well.,One’s partner could be abusive, controlling,emotionally draining, or simply not the right,fit.,Also, a relationship requires time and effort,which some people prefer to spend on other,things.,A downside could be that we become too selective,leading to us wanting a significant other,but not being able to find them.,‘Not needing someone’ means that we canend the relationship with that person more,easily and quickly, which is also true whenit comes to friends.,Not needing friends allows us to end toxicfriendships and set boundaries for the rest.,And when we don’t have to make friends outof necessity, we’re more likely to befriend,people we genuinely like, connect with, andshare interests with.,The major downside of belonging to a groupis the expectation of conformity: belonging,requires us to adapt.,Often, this means that people expect us, inmany regards, to do as they do, speak as they,speak, and, not uncommonly, think as theythink.,The meaning of Sartre’s famous quote, “Hellis other people,” is often misunderstood.,People generally interpret it as saying thatothers are terrible and that we’re better,off avoiding them altogether.,This isn’t precisely what Sartre meant.,The quote pointed to Sartre’s observationthat we’re never free from other people’s,gaze and their opinions of us.,And the more people we surround ourselveswith, the more judging eyes we endure.,These opinions and expectations can have aprofound impact on us, and we may, therefore,,feel trapped to conform to social expectations.,Some people desire to conform and willinglyadopt other people’s opinions and mannerisms,out of a desire for belonging.,And when observing people’s overall behavior,we could say that most of us care about the,gaze of others.,Most of us like it when people approve ofus, estimate us highly, and respect us.,In many cases, to gain the validation of others,we jump through the hoops they’ve set in,place for us as trained monkeys.,German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticizedhuman infatuation with other people’s opinions,,saying:,By a peculiar weakness of human nature, peoplegenerally think too much about the opinion,which others form of them; although the slightestreflection will show that this opinion, whatever,it may be, is not in itself essential to happiness.,Therefore it is hard to understand why everybodyfeels so very pleased when he sees that other,people have a good opinion of him, or sayanything flattering to his vanity.,End quote.,Isn’t our pursuit of approval detrimentalto our authenticity?,What if we didn’t need the validation ofothers for our happiness or, at least, only,the minimum to function and survive in society?,We could seize the freedom to shape ourselvesand our lives in ways we prefer.,Taking this freedom doesn’t necessarilymean we’re antisocial, without compassion,,or full of ill will toward others.,It’s just that we don’t let their gazedictate how we live authentically.,Philosopher Nietzsche goes even further, encouragingus to break with the herd, liberate ourselves,from slave morality, and transcend the humancondition by becoming the “Overman.”,According to Nietzsche, society and its moralcodes hold individuals back from realizing,their full potential.,The “Overmen” surpass these limitations,creating their own authentic values and meaning.,Whether we choose to engage in self-actualizationor just want to enjoy the tranquility of solitude,,‘not needing people’ allows us to chooseour own direction.,Not needing people isn’t to deny the importanceof human connection, a natural inclination,that varies per individual.,For most people, human connection probablyplays a significant role in their overall,well-being, and the harmful effects of lonelinessand social isolation are real.,Not needing people doesn’t imply not associatingwith people at all but grants us the possibility,to embrace solitude when desired.,When we can fend for ourselves, we can associatewith people, befriend them, and even be in,intimate relationships with them, but withthe freedom to walk away whenever we please,and indulge in the tranquility of solitude,far away from human turmoil.,Thank you for watching.
